>gnl|CDD|257221 pfam12685, SpoIIIAH, SpoIIIAH-like protein.  Stage III sporulation 
protein AH (SpoIIIAH) is a protein that is involved in 
forespore engulfment. It forms a channel with SpoIIIAH that 
is open on the forespore end and closed (or gated) on the mother 
cell end. This allows sigma-E-directed gene expression 
in the mother-cell compartment of the sporangium to trigger 
the activation of sigma-G forespore-specific gene expression 
by a pathway of intercellular signaling. This family of proteins 
is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and so must 
have a wider function that in sporulation. Proteins in this 
family are typically between 174 and 223 amino acids in 
length.

>gnl|CDD|176249 cd08289, MDR_yhfp_like, Yhfp putative quinone oxidoreductases. 
 yhfp putative quinone oxidoreductases (QOR). QOR catalyzes 
the conversion of a quinone  + NAD(P)H to a hydroquinone + 
NAD(P)+. Quinones are cyclic diones derived from aromatic compounds. 
Membrane bound QOR actin the respiratory chains of 
bacteria and mitochondria, while soluble QOR acts to protect 
from toxic quinones (e.g. DT-diaphorase) or as a soluble eye-lens 
protein in some vertebrates (e.g. zeta-crystalin). QOR 
reduces quinones through a semi-quinone intermediate via 
a NAD(P)H-dependent single electron transfer. QOR is a member 
of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, but lacks 
the zinc-binding sites of the prototypical alcohol dehydrogenases 
of this group.  NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases 
are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and 
aldehydes, or ketones.  Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver 
converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while 
in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion 
acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.  
ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family 
(MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann 
fold of a beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is 
comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts 
a mononucleotide.  A GxGxxG motif after the first mononucleotide 
contact half allows the close contact of the coenzyme 
with the ADH backbone.  The N-terminal catalytic domain 
has a distant homology to GroES.  These proteins typically 
form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers 
(yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per 
subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site, and a structural 
zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain.  NAD(H) binding occurs 
in the cleft between the catalytic and coenzyme-binding 
domains at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a 
conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically 
precedes and contributes to substrate binding. In human 
ADH catalysis, the zinc ion helps coordinate the alcohol, 
followed by deprotonation of a histidine, the ribose of NAD, 
a serine, then the alcohol, which allows the transfer of a 
hydride to NAD+, creating NADH and a zinc-bound aldehyde or 
ketone. In yeast and some bacteria, the active site zinc binds 
an aldehyde, polarizing it, and leading to the reverse reaction.

in fungi is controlled by the loci that determine the mating 
type of an individual, and only individuals with differing 
mating types can mate. Basidiomycete fungi have evolved 
a unique mating system, termed tetrapolar or bifactorial incompatibility, 
in which mating type is determined by two unlinked 
loci; compatibility at both loci is required for mating 
to occur. The multi-allelic tetrapolar mating system is considered 
to be a novel innovation that could have only evolved 
once, and is thus unique to the mushroom fungi. This domain 
is C-terminal to the homeodomain transcription factor region.
