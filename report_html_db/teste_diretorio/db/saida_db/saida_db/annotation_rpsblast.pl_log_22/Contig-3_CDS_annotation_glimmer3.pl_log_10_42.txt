>gnl|CDD|238243 cd00427, Ribosomal_L29_HIP, Ribosomal L29 protein/HIP.  L29 is 
a protein of the large ribosomal Subunit. A homolog, called 
heparin/heparan sulfate interacting protein (HIP), has also 
been identified in mammals.  L29 is located on the surface 
of the large ribosomal subunit, where it participates in forming 
a protein ring that surrounds the polypeptide exit channel, 
providing structural support for the ribosome.  L29 is 
involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with 
L19, L22, L23, L24, and L31e.  In addition, L29 and L23 form 
the interaction site for trigger factor (TF) on the ribosomal 
surface, adjacent to the exit tunnel.  L29 forms numerous 
interactions with L23 and with the 23S rRNA. In some eukaryotes, 
L29 is referred to as L35, which is distinct from L35 
found in bacteria and some eukaryotes (primarily plastids and 
mitochondria).  The mammalian homolog, HIP, is found on the 
surface of many tissues and cell lines. It is believed to 
play a role in cell adhesion and modulation of blood coagulation. 
It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cancer 
cells.

>gnl|CDD|271157 cd07954, AP_MHD_Cterm, C-terminal domain of adaptor protein (AP) 
complexes medium mu subunits and its homologs (MHD).  This 
family corresponds to the C-terminal domain of heterotetrameric 
AP complexes medium mu subunits and its homologs existing 
in monomeric stonins, delta-subunit of the heteroheptameric 
coat protein I (delta-COPI), a protein encoded by a pro-death 
gene referred as MuD (also known as MUDENG, mu-2 related 
death-inducing gene), an endocytic adaptor syp1, the mammalian 
FCH domain only proteins (FCHo1/2), SH3-containing GRB2-like 
protein 3-interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), and related 
proteins. AP complexes participate in the formation of intracellular 
coated transport vesicles and select cargo molecules 
for incorporation into the coated vesicles in the late secretory 
and endocytic pathways. Stonins have been characterized 
as clathrin-dependent AP-2 mu chain related factors and 
may act as cargo-specific sorting adaptors in endocytosis. Coat 
protein complex I (COPI)-coated vesicles function in the 
early secretory pathway. They mediate the retrograde transport 
from the Golgi to the ER, and intra-Golgi transport. MuD 
is distantly related to the C-terminal domain of mu2 subunit 
of AP-2. It is able to induce cell death by itself and plays 
an important role in cell death in various tissues. Syp1 
represents a novel type of endocytic adaptor protein that participates 
in endocytosis, promotes vesicle tabulation, and 
contributes to cell polarity and stress responses. It shares 
the same domain architecture with its two ubiquitously expressed 
mammalian counterparts, FCHo1/2, which represent key initial 
proteins ultimately controlling cellular nutrient uptake, 
receptor regulation, and synaptic vesicle retrieval. They 
bind specifically to the plasma membrane and recruit the 
scaffold proteins eps15 and intersectin, which subsequently 
engage the adaptor complex AP2 and clathrin, leading to coated 
vesicle formation. Another mammalian neuronal-specific protein 
SGIP1 does have a C-terminal MHD and has been classified 
into this family as well. It is an endophilin-interacting 
protein that plays an obligatory role in the regulation of 
energy homeostasis. It is also involved in clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis by interacting with phospholipids and eps15.
