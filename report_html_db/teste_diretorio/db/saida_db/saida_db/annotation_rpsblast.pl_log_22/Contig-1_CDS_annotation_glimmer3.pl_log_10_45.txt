in eukaryotes) is a core protein of the large ribosomal subunit. 
 It is the only ribosomal protein that interacts with 
all six domains of 23S rRNA, and is one of the proteins important 
for directing the proper folding and stabilizing the conformation 
of 23S rRNA.  L22 is the largest protein contributor 
to the surface of the polypeptide exit channel, the tunnel 
through which the polypeptide product passes.  L22 is also 
one of six proteins located at the putative translocon binding 
site on the exterior surface of the ribosome.

>gnl|CDD|239311 cd03013, PRX5_like, Peroxiredoxin (PRX) family, PRX5-like subfamily; 
members are similar to the human protein, PRX5, a homodimeric 
TRX peroxidase, widely expressed in tissues and found 
cellularly in mitochondria, peroxisomes and the cytosol. 
The cellular location of PRX5 suggests that it may have an 
important antioxidant role in organelles that are major sources 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as a role in the 
control of signal transduction. PRX5 has been shown to reduce 
hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite. 
As with all other PRXs, the N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine 
of PRX5 is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate upon 
reaction with peroxides. Human PRX5 is able to resolve this 
intermediate by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond 
with its C-terminal cysteine (the resolving cysteine), which 
can then be reduced by TRX, just like an atypical 2-cys PRX. 
This resolving cysteine, however, is not conserved in other 
members of the subfamily. In such cases, it is assumed that 
the oxidized cysteine is directly resolved by an external 
small-molecule or protein reductant, typical of a 1-cys PRX. 
In the case of the H. influenza PRX5 hybrid, the resolving 
glutaredoxin domain is on the same protein chain as PRX. PRX5 
homodimers show an A-type interface, similar to atypical 2-cys 
PRXs.

>gnl|CDD|270985 cd14083, STKc_CaMKI, Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine 
kinase, Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Type I. 
 STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from 
ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. 
CaMKs are multifunctional calcium and calmodulin (CaM) stimulated 
STKs involved in cell cycle regulation. There are several 
types of CaMKs including CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV. In vertebrates, 
there are four CaMKI proteins encoded by different 
genes (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), each producing at 
least one variant. CaMKs contain an N-terminal catalytic domain 
and a C-terminal regulatory domain that harbors a CaM binding 
site. CaMKI proteins are monomeric and they play pivotal 
roles in the nervous system, including long-term potentiation, 
dendritic arborization, neurite outgrowth, and the formation 
of spines, synapses, and axons. In addition, they may 
be involved in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. 
The CaMKI subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that 
includes the catalytic domains of other protein kinases, RIO 
kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, 
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

>gnl|CDD|173960 cd08550, GlyDH-like, Glycerol_dehydrogenase-like.  Families of 
proteins related to glycerol dehydrogenases. Glycerol dehydrogenases 
(GlyDH) is a key enzyme in the glycerol dissimilation 
pathway. In anaerobic conditions, many microorganisms utilize 
glycerol as a source of carbon through coupled oxidative 
and reductive pathways. One of the pathways involves the 
oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone with the reduction 
of NAD+ to NADH catalyzed by glycerol dehydrogenases. Dihydroxyacetone 
is then phosphorylated by dihydroxyacetone kinase 
and enters the glycolytic pathway for further degradation. 
The activity of GlyDH is zinc-dependent. The zinc ion plays 
a role in stabilizing an alkoxide intermediate at the active 
site. Some subfamilies have not been characterized till now.

>gnl|CDD|239104 cd02424, Peptidase_C39E, A sub-family of peptidase family C39. 
Peptidase family C39 mostly contains bacteriocin-processing 
endopeptidases from bacteria. The cysteine peptidases in family 
C39 cleave the "double-glycine" leader peptides from the 
precursors of various bacteriocins (mostly non-lantibiotic). 
The cleavage is mediated by the transporter as part of the 
secretion process. Bacteriocins are antibiotic proteins secreted 
by some species of bacteria that inhibit the growth 
of other bacterial species. The bacteriocin is synthesized as 
a precursor with an N-terminal leader peptide, and processing 
involves removal of the leader peptide by cleavage at a 
Gly-Gly bond, followed by translocation of the mature bacteriocin 
across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most endopeptidases of 
family C39 are N-terminal domains in larger proteins (ABC 
transporters) that serve both functions. The proposed protease 
active site is conserved in this sub-family, which contains 
Colicin V perocessing peptidase.

>gnl|CDD|240937 cd12493, RRM2_DND1, RNA recognition motif 2 found in vertebrate 
dead end protein homolog 1 (DND1).  This subgroup corresponds 
to the RRM2 of DND1, also termed RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting 
protein 4. It is an RNA-binding protein 
that is essential for maintaining viable germ cells in 
vertebrates. It interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) 
of multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and prevents micro-RNA 
(miRNA) mediated repression of mRNA. For instance, DND1 
binds cell cycle inhibitor, P27 (p27Kip1, CDKN1B), and cell 
cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, LATS2 (large tumor suppressor, 
homolog 2 of Drosophila). It helps maintain their 
protein expression through blocking the inhibitory function 
of microRNAs (miRNA) from these transcripts. DND1 may also impose 
another level of translational regulation to modulate 
expression of critical factors in embryonic stem (ES) cells. 
Moreover, DND1 interacts specifically with apolipoprotein B 
editing complex 3 (APOBEC3), a multi-functional protein inhibiting 
retroviral replication. The DND1-APOBEC3 interaction 
may play a role in maintaining viability of germ cells and 
for preventing germ cell tumor development. DND1 contains two 
conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), also termed RBDs 
(RNA binding domains) or RNPs (ribonucleoprotein domains). .
