>gnl|CDD|252370 pfam04097, Nic96, Nup93/Nic96.  Nup93/Nic96 is a component of 
the nuclear pore complex. It is required for the correct assembly 
of the nuclear pore complex. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
Nic96 has been shown to be involved in the distribution 
and cellular concentration of the GTPase Gsp1. The structure 
of Nic96 has revealed a mostly alpha helical structure.

>gnl|CDD|256893 pfam12183, NotI, Restriction endonuclease NotI.  This family 
of proteins is found in bacteria. Proteins in this family are 
typically between 270 and 341 amino acids in length. There 
is a conserved CPF sequence motif. The type IIP restriction 
enzyme, NotI, is a homodimer that recognizes the 8 bp DNA sequence 
5'-GC/GGCCGC-3' and cleaves both strands of DNA to create 
5', 4 base cohesive overhangs.

>gnl|CDD|129854 TIGR00771, DcuC, c4-dicarboxylate anaerobic carrier family protein. 
 These proteins are members of the C4-dicarboxylate Uptake 
C (DcuC) Family (TC 2.A.61). The only functionally characterized 
member of this family is the anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate 
transporter (DcuC) of Escherichia coli. DcuC has 12 GES 
predicted transmembrane regions, is induced only under anaerobic 
conditions, and is not repressed by glucose. It may 
therefore function as a succinate efflux system during anaerobic 
glucose fermentation. However, when overexpressed, it can 
replace either DcuA or DcuB in catalyzing fumarate-succinate 
exchange and fumarate uptake [Transport and binding proteins, 
Carbohydrates, organic alcohols, and acids].
