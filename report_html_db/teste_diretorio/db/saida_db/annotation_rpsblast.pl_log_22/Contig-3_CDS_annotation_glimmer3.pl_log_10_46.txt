>gnl|CDD|271117 cd14215, PKc_CLK2, Catalytic domain of the Dual-specificity protein 
kinase, CDC-like kinase 2.  Dual-specificity PKs catalyze 
the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to 
serine/threonine as well as tyrosine residues on protein substrates. 
CLK2 plays a role in hepatic insulin signaling and 
glucose metabolism. It is induced by the insulin/Akt pathway 
as part of the hepatic refeeding reponse, and it directly phosphorylates 
the SR domain of PGC-1alpha, which results in 
decreased gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose output. 
CLKs are involved in the phosphorylation and regulation of serine/arginine-rich 
(SR) proteins, which play a crucial role 
in pre-mRNA splicing by directing splice site selection. SR 
proteins are phosphorylated first by SR protein kinases (SRPKs) 
at the N-terminus, which leads to its assembly into nuclear 
speckles where splicing factors are stored. CLKs phosphorylate 
the C-terminal part of SR proteins, causing the nuclear 
speckles to dissolve and splicing factors to be recruited 
at sites of active transcription. Based on a conserved "EHLAMMERILG" 
signature motif which may be crucial for substrate 
specificity, CLKs are also referred to as LAMMER kinases. 
CLKs autophosphorylate at tyrosine residues and phosphorylate 
their substrates exclusively on serine/threonine residues. 
The CLK2 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes 
the catalytic domains of other protein serine/threonine 
PKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside 
phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

the oxygenase alpha subunit of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase 
(NDO) and related aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenases. 
 C-terminal catalytic domain of the oxygenase alpha subunit 
of naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (NDO) and related Rieske-type 
non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs, 
also known as aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenases). This 
domain binds non-heme Fe(II).  RHOs utilize non-heme Fe(II) 
to catalyze the addition of hydroxyl groups to the aromatic 
ring, an initial step in the oxidative degradation of aromatic 
compounds. RHOs are composed of either two or three protein 
components, and are comprised of an electron transport 
chain (ETC) and an oxygenase. The ETC transfers reducing equivalents 
form the electron donor to the oxygenase component, 
which in turn transfers electrons to the oxygen molecules. 
The oxygenase components are oligomers, either (alpha)n or 
(alpha)n(beta)n. The alpha subunits are the catalytic components 
and have an N-terminal domain, which binds a Rieske-like 
2Fe-2S cluster, and a C-terminal domain which binds the non-heme 
Fe(II). The Fe(II) is co-ordinated by conserved His and 
Asp residues. Proteins belonging to this subgroup include 
the terminal oxygenase alpha subunits of biphenyl dioxygenase, 
cumene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas fluorescens IP01, ethylbenzene 
dioxygenase, naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, nitrobenzene 
dioxygenase from Comamonas sp. strain JS765, toluene 2,3-dioxygenase 
from Pseudomonas putida F1, dioxin dioxygenase 
of Sphingomonas sp. Strain RW1, and the polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs)degrading ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase 
from Sphingomonas CHY-1. This subfamily belongs to the SRPBCC 
(START/RHO_alpha_C/PITP/Bet_v1/CoxG/CalC) domain superfamily 
of proteins that bind hydrophobic ligands. SRPBCC domains 
have a deep hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket.

divalent-metal-ion dependent, 5' nuclease and 
homologs.  Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) is involved in multiple 
DNA metabolic pathways, including DNA replication processes 
(5' flap DNA endonuclease activity and double stranded DNA 
5'-exonuclease activity) and DNA repair processes (long-patch 
base excision repair) in eukaryotes and archaea. Interaction 
between FEN1 and PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) 
is an essential prerequisite to FEN1's DNA replication functionality 
and stimulates FEN1 nuclease activity by 10-50 
fold. FEN1 belongs to the FEN1-EXO1-like family of structure-specific, 
5' nucleases. These nucleases contain a PIN (PilT 
N terminus) domain with a helical arch/clamp region (I domain) 
of variable length (approximately 45 residues in FEN1 PIN 
domains) and a H3TH (helix-3-turn-helix) domain, an atypical 
helix-hairpin-helix-2-like region.  Both the H3TH domain 
(not included here) and the helical arch/clamp region are involved 
in DNA binding. Nucleases within this group also have 
a carboxylate-rich active site that is involved in binding 
essential divalent metal ion cofactors (Mg2+/Mn2+).  FEN1 has 
a C-terminal extension containing residues forming the consensus 
PIP-box - Qxx(M/L/I)xxF(Y/F) which serves to anchor FEN1 
to PCNA.

>gnl|CDD|187649 cd08945, PKR_SDR_c, Polyketide ketoreductase, classical (c) SDR. 
 Polyketide ketoreductase (KR) is a classical SDR with a 
characteristic NAD-binding pattern and active site tetrad. 
 Aromatic polyketides include various aromatic compounds of 
pharmaceutical interest. Polyketide KR, part of the type II 
polyketide synthase (PKS) complex, is comprised of stand-alone 
domains that resemble the domains found in fatty acid synthase 
and multidomain type I PKS. SDRs are a functionally diverse 
family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with 
a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding 
pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, 
and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical 
SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended 
SDRS are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between 
different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, 
but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif 
and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. 
These enzymes have a 3-glycine N-terminal NAD(P)(H)-binding 
pattern (typically, TGxxxGxG in classical SDRs and TGxxGxxG 
in extended SDRs), while substrate binding is in the C-terminal 
region. A critical catalytic Tyr residue (Tyr-151, human 
15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering), 
is often found in a conserved YXXXK pattern. In addition 
to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 
15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) 
or additional Ser, contributing to the active site. Substrates 
for these enzymes include sugars, steroids, alcohols, 
and aromatic compounds. The standard reaction mechanism is 
a proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, as well 
as Asn (or Ser). Some SDR family members, including 17 beta-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase contain an additional helix-turn-helix 
motif that is not generally found among SDRs.

>gnl|CDD|271231 cd15467, MV-h, Measles virus hemagglutinin.  The hemagglutinin 
(H) of measles virus plays several roles during viral infection; 
it participates in virus attachment to host cells via 
binding to a proteinaceous receptor and it has a stimulating 
effect on membrane fusion during the entry of the virus into 
the host cell by interacting with the fusion protein F. This 
model characterizes the globular ectodomain of measles hemagglutinin, 
minus the stalk region. Receptors for measles 
virus have been identified as the signaling lymphocyte activation 
molecule (SLAM, in particular its distal ectodomain), 
CD46, and nectin-4 in epithelial cells.
