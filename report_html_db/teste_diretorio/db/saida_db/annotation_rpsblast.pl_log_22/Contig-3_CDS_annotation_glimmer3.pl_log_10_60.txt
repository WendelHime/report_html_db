>gnl|CDD|239994 cd04622, CBS_pair_9, The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is 
a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase 
and is subsequently found in a wide range of different 
proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. 
They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair 
based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS 
pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human 
CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form 
an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two 
CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding 
site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional 
domains and this has been used to help in its classification 
here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play 
a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. 
Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated 
with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including 
congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric 
nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC 
chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome 
(gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis 
pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria 
(cystathionine beta-synthase).

>gnl|CDD|213325 cd12117, A_NRPS_Srf_like, The adenylation domain of nonribosomal 
peptide synthetases (NRPS), including Bacillus subtilis 
termination module Surfactin (SrfA-C).  The adenylation (A) 
domain of NRPS recognizes a specific amino acid or hydroxy acid 
and activates it as an (amino) acyl adenylate by hydrolysis 
of ATP. The activated acyl moiety then forms a thioester 
to the enzyme-bound cofactor phosphopantetheine of a peptidyl 
carrier protein domain. NRPSs are large multifunctional enzymes 
which synthesize many therapeutically useful peptides 
in bacteria and fungi via a template-directed, nucleic acid 
independent nonribosomal mechanism. These natural products 
include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, plant and animal toxins, 
and enzyme inhibitors. NRPS has a distinct modular structure 
in which each module is responsible for the recognition, 
activation, and, in some cases, modification of a single 
amino acid residue of the final peptide product. The modules 
can be subdivided into domains that catalyze specific biochemical 
reactions. This family includes the adenylation domain 
of the Bacillus subtilis termination module (Surfactin domain, 
SrfA-C) which recognizes a specific amino acid building 
block, which is then activated and transferred to the terminal 
thiol of the 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppan) arm of the downstream 
peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain.

>gnl|CDD|187573 cd05263, MupV_like_SDR_e, Pseudomonas fluorescens MupV-like, 
extended (e) SDRs.  This subgroup of extended SDR family domains 
have the characteristic active site tetrad and a well-conserved 
NAD(P)-binding motif. This subgroup is not well characterized, 
its members are annotated as having a variety of 
putative functions. One characterized member is Pseudomonas 
fluorescens MupV a protein  involved in the biosynthesis of 
Mupirocin, a polyketide-derived antibiotic. Extended SDRs are 
distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann 
fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) 
core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less 
conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. 
Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and 
include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; 
they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs 
are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that 
have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann 
fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse 
C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR 
enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide 
range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, 
cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and 
amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an 
TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site 
motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving 
as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin 
dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr 
and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing 
to the active site; while substrate binding is in 
the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard 
reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and 
proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule 
stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally 
lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, 
and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different 
from the forms normally seen in classical or extended 
SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains 
of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif 
and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl 
reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.

>gnl|CDD|271004 cd14102, STKc_PIM3, Catalytic domain of the Serine/Threonine 
kinase, Proviral Integration Moloney virus (PIM) kinase 3.  
STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from 
ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. The 
PIM gene locus was discovered as a result of the cloning of 
retroviral intergration sites in murine Moloney leukemia virus, 
leading to the identification of PIM kinases. They are 
constitutively active STKs with a broad range of cellular targets 
and are overexpressed in many haematopoietic malignancies 
and solid cancers. Vertebrates contain three distinct PIM 
kinase genes (PIM1-3). PIM3 can inhibit apoptosis and promote 
cell survival and protein translation, therefore, it can 
enhance the proliferation of normal and cancer cells. Mice 
deficient with PIM3 show minimal effects, suggesting that PIM3 
msy not be essential. Since its expression is enhanced in 
several cancers, it may make a good molecular target for cancer 
drugs. The PIM3 subfamily is part of a larger superfamily 
that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, 
protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, 
choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
