>gnl|CDD|253410 pfam05833, FbpA, Fibronectin-binding protein A N-terminus (FbpA). 
 This family consists of the N-terminal region of the prokaryotic 
fibronectin-binding protein. Fibronectin binding 
is considered to be an important virulence factor in streptococcal 
infections. Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein that 
is present in a soluble form in plasma and extracellular fluids; 
it is also present in a fibrillar form on cell surfaces. 
Both the soluble and cellular forms of fibronectin may be 
incorporated into the extracellular tissue matrix. While fibronectin 
has critical roles in eukaryotic cellular processes, 
such as adhesion, migration and differentiation, it is also 
a substrate for the attachment of bacteria. The binding 
of pathogenic Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus 
to epithelial cells via fibronectin facilitates their internalisation 
and systemic spread within the host.

GK2. Sequence comparison shows members in this CD are homologs 
of Escherichia coli GK. They retain all functionally 
important residues, and may catalyze the Mg-ATP dependent phosphorylation 
of glycerol to yield glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). 
GKs belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the

by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model 
includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease

inner mitochondrial membranes link NAD(P)(H)-dependent redox 
reactions to proton translocation. The energy of the proton 
electrochemical gradient (delta-p), generated by the respiratory 
electron transport chain, is consumed by transhydrogenase 
in NAD(P)+ reduction. Transhydrogenase is likely involved 
in the regulation of the citric acid cycle. Rubrum transhydrogenase 
has 3 components, dI, dII, and dIII. dII spans 
the membrane while dI and dIII protrude on the cytoplasmic/matrix 
side. DI contains 2 domains in Rossmann-like folds, linked 
by a long alpha helix, and contains a NAD binding site. 
Two dI polypeptides (represented in this sub-family) spontaneously 
form a heterotrimer with dIII in the absence of dII. 
In the heterotrimer, both dI chains may bind NAD, but only 
one is well-ordered. dIII also binds a well-ordered NADP, but 
in a different orientation than a classical Rossmann domain.

two isoforms of the non-essential polymerase RNAP IV (IVa and

pathways. RNAP IVa and/or RNAP IVb might be involved in RNA-directed 
DNA methylation of endogenous repetitive elements, 
silencing of transgenes, regulation of flowering-time genes, 
inducible regulation of adjacent gene pairs, and spreading 
of mobile silencing signals. NRPD1a is the largest subunit

IVb. The full subunit compositions of RNAP IVa and RNAP IVb

>gnl|CDD|153339 cd07655, F-BAR_PACSIN, The F-BAR (FES-CIP4 Homology and Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) 
domain of Protein kinase C and Casein kinase 
Substrate in Neurons (PACSIN) proteins.  F-BAR domains are 
dimerization modules that bind and bend membranes and are found 
in proteins involved in membrane dynamics and actin reorganization. 
Protein kinase C and Casein kinase Substrate in 
Neurons (PACSIN) proteins, also called Synaptic dynamin-associated 
proteins (Syndapins), act as regulators of cytoskeletal 
and membrane dynamics. They bind both dynamin and Wiskott-Aldrich 
syndrome protein (WASP), and may provide direct links 
between the actin cytoskeletal machinery through WASP and 
dynamin-dependent endocytosis. Vetebrates harbor three isoforms 
with distinct expression patterns and specific functions. 
PACSINs contain an N-terminal F-BAR domain and a C-terminal 
SH3 domain. F-BAR domains form banana-shaped dimers with 
a positively-charged concave surface that binds to negatively-charged 
lipid membranes. They can induce membrane deformation 
in the form of long tubules.

 Members of this protein family are polyribonucleotide 
nucleotidyltransferase, also called polynucleotide phosphorylase. 
Some members have been shown also to have additional 
functions as guanosine pentaphosphate synthetase and as poly(A) 
polymerase (see model TIGR02696 for an exception clade, 
within this family) [Transcription, Degradation of RNA].

ligase.  Members of this protein 
family are MshC, l-cysteine:1-D-myo-inosityl 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 
ligase, an enzyme that uses ATP 
to ligate a Cys residue to a mycothiol precursor molecule, 
in the second to last step in mycothiol biosynthesis. This 
enzyme shows considerable homology to Cys--tRNA ligases, and 
many instances are misannotated as such. Mycothiol is found 
in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, 
Streptomyces coelicolor, and various other members of the Actinobacteria. 
Mycothiol is an analog to glutathione [Biosynthesis 
of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers, Glutathione 
and analogs].
