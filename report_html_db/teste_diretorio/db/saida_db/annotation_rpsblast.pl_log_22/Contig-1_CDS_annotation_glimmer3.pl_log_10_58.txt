>gnl|CDD|191646 pfam06943, zf-LSD1, LSD1 zinc finger.  This family consists of 
several plant specific LSD1 zinc finger domains. Arabidopsis 
lsd1 mutants are hyper-responsive to cell death initiators 
and fail to limit the extent of cell death. Superoxide is 
a necessary and sufficient signal for cell death propagation. 
LSD1 monitors a superoxide-dependent signal and negatively 
regulates a plant cell death pathway. LSD1 protein contains 
three zinc finger domains, defined by CxxCxRxxLMYxxGASxVxCxxC. 
It has been suggested that LSD1 defines a zinc finger protein 
subclass and that LSD1 regulates transcription, via either 
repression of a pro-death pathway or activation of an anti-death 
pathway, in response to signals emanating from cells 
undergoing pathogen-induced hypersensitive cell death.
