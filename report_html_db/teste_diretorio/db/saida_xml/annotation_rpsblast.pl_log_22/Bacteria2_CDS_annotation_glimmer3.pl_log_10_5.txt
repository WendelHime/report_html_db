 Members of this family of small ribosomal proteins possess 
one of three conserved blocks of sequence found in proteins 
that stimulate the dissociation of guanine nucleotides from 
G-proteins, leaving open the possibility that MRP-S27 might 
be a functional partner of GTP-binding ribosomal proteins.

family consists of several eukaryotic splicing factor 3B 
subunit 10 (SF3b10) proteins. SF3b10 is a 10 kDa subunit of 
the splicing factor SF3b. SF3b associates with the splicing 
factor SF3a and a 12S RNA unit to form the U2 small nuclear 
ribonucleoproteins complex. SF3b10 and SF3b14b are also thought 
to facilitate the interaction of U2 with the branch site.

>gnl|CDD|270298 cd13580, PBP2_AlgQ_like_1, Periplasmic-binding component of alginate-specific 
ABC uptake system-like; contains the type 2 
periplasmic binding fold.  This subgroup includes uncharacterized 
periplasmic-binding proteins that are closely related 
to high molecular weight (HMW) alginate bining proteins (AlgQ1 
and AlgQ2) found in gram-negative soil bacteria. The HMW 
alginate uptake system is composed of a novel pit formed on 
the cell surface and a pit-dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
transporter in the inner membrane. The transportation of 
HMW alginate from the pit to the ABC transporter is mediated 
by periplasmic HMW alginate-binding proteins (AlgQ1 and AlgQ2). 
 Alginate is an anionic polysaccharide that is made up 
of alpha-L-mannuronate and its 5'-epimer, alpha-L-guluronate. 
Alginate is present in the cell walls of brown seaweeds, 
where it forms a viscous gum by binding water. Alginate is 
also produced by two bacteria genera Pseudomonas and Azotobacter. 
AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 belong to the type 2 periplasmic-binding 
fold superfamily. PBP2 is comprised of two globular subdomains 
connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in 
the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus 
flytrap. However, unlike other bacterial periplasmic-binding 
proteins that deliver small solutes to ABC transporters, 
AlgQ1/2 can bind a macromolecule and may have specificity 
for either sugar or a certain type of polysaccharide.

>gnl|CDD|270389 cd13671, PBP2_TRAP_SBP_like_3, Uncharacterized substrate-binding 
protein of the Tripartite ATP-independent  Periplasmic transporter 
family; the type 2 periplasmic-binding protein fold. 
 This subfamily includes uncharacterized periplasmic substrate-binding 
proteins similar to TRAP transport systems such 
as SiaP (a sialic acid binding virulence factor) and TeaA 
(an ectoine binding protein). TRAP transporters are a large 
family of solute transporters ubiquitously found in bacteria 
and archaea. They are comprised of a periplasmic substrate-binding 
protein (SBP) and two unequally sized integral membrane 
components: a large transmembrane subunit involved in the 
translocation process and a smaller membrane of unknown function. 
The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided 
by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) 
across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. 
This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic 
binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2). The PBP2 
proteins are typically comprised of two globular subdomains 
connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft 
between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.

>gnl|CDD|270453 cd14750, PBP2_TMBP, The periplasmic-binding component of ABC 
transport systems specific for trehalose/maltose; possesses 
type 2 periplasmic binding fold.  This group represents the 
periplasmic trehalose/maltose-binding component of an ABC transport 
system and related proteins from archaea and bacteria. 
Members of this group belong to the type 2 periplasmic-binding 
fold superfamily. PBP2 proteins are comprised of two globular 
subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their 
ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling 
a Venus flytrap. The majority of PBP2 proteins function 
in the uptake of small soluble substrates in eubacteria 
and archaea. After binding their specific ligand with high 
affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport 
complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two 
cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers 
the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane 
energized by ATP hydrolysis.

domain of Fes (feline sarcoma) tyrosine kinase. 
 F-BAR domains are dimerization modules that bind and bend 
membranes and are found in proteins involved in membrane dynamics 
and actin reorganization. Fes (feline sarcoma), also called 
Fps (Fujinami poultry sarcoma), is a cytoplasmic (or nonreceptor) 
tyrosine kinase whose gene was first isolated from 
tumor-causing retroviruses. It is expressed in myeloid, vascular 
endothelial, epithelial, and neuronal cells, and plays 
important roles in cell growth and differentiation, angiogenesis, 
inflammation and immunity, and cytoskeletal regulation. 
Fes kinase has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor 
in colorectal cancer. It contains an N-terminal F-BAR domain, 
an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain. 
F-BAR domains form banana-shaped dimers with a positively-charged 
concave surface that binds to negatively-charged lipid 
membranes. They can induce membrane deformation in the form 
of long tubules. The F-BAR domain of Fes is critical in its 
role in microtubule nucleation and bundling.
