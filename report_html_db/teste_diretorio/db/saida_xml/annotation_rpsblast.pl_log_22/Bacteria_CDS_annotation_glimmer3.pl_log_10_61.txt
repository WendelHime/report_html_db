>gnl|CDD|204181 pfam09251, PhageP22-tail, Salmonella phage P22 tail-spike.  Members 
of this family of viral domains adopt a structure consisting 
of a single-stranded right-handed beta-helix, which 
in turn is made of parallel beta-strands and short turns. They 
are required for recognition of the 0-antigenic repeating 
units of the cell surface, and for subsequent infection of 
the bacterial cell.
