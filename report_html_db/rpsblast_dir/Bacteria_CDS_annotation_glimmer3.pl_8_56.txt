>gnl|CDD|153099 cd00907, Bacterioferritin, Bacterioferritin, ferritin-like diiron-binding 
domain.  Bacterioferritins, also known as cytochrome 
b1, are members of a broad superfamily of ferritin-like 
diiron-carboxylate proteins. Similar to ferritin in architecture, 
Bfr forms an oligomer of 24 subunits that assembles 
to form a hollow sphere with 432 symmetry. Up to 12 heme cofactor 
groups (iron protoporphyrin IX or coproporphyrin III) 
are bound between dimer pairs. The role of the heme is unknown, 
although it may be involved in mediating iron-core reduction 
and iron release. Each subunit is composed of a four-helix 
bundle which carries a diiron ferroxidase center; it is 
here that initial oxidation of ferrous iron by molecular oxygen 
occurs, facilitating the detoxification of iron, protection 
against dioxygen and radical products, and storage of ferric-hydroxyphosphate 
at the core. Some bacterioferritins are 
composed of two subunit types, one conferring heme-binding 
ability (alpha) and the other (beta) bestowing ferroxidase 
activity.

domain.  DPSL (DPS-like).  DPSL is a phylogenetically distinct 
class within the ferritin-like superfamily, and similar 
in many ways to the DPS (DNA Protecting protein under Starved 
conditions) proteins. Like DPS, these proteins are expressed 
in response to oxidative stress, form dodecameric cage-like 
particles, preferentially utilize hydrogen peroxide in the 
controlled oxidation of iron, and possess a short N-terminal 
extension implicated in stabilizing cellular DNA.  This domain 
is a member of a broad superfamily of ferritin-like diiron-carboxylate 
proteins. These proteins are distantly related 
to bacterial ferritins which assemble 24 monomers,  each 
of which have a four-helix bundle with a fifth shorter helix 
at the C terminus and a diiron (ferroxidase) center. Ferritins 
contain a center where oxidation of ferrous iron by molecular 
oxygen occurs, facilitating the detoxification of iron, 
protection against dioxygen and radical products, and storage 
of iron in the ferric form. Many of the conserved residues 
of a diiron center are present in this domain.

>gnl|CDD|153102 cd01043, DPS, DPS protein, ferritin-like diiron-binding domain. 
 DPS (DNA Protecting protein under Starved conditions) domain 
is a member of a broad superfamily of ferritin-like diiron-carboxylate 
proteins. Some DPS proteins nonspecifically 
bind DNA, protecting it from cleavage caused by reactive oxygen 
species such as the hydroxyl radicals produced during oxidation 
of Fe(II) by hydrogen peroxide. These proteins assemble 
into dodecameric structures, some form DPS-DNA co-crystalline 
complexes, and possess iron and H2O2 detoxification capabilities. 
Expression of DPS is induced by oxidative or nutritional 
stress, including metal ion starvation. Members of 
the DPS family are homopolymers formed by 12 four-helix bundle 
subunits that assemble with 23 symmetry into a hollow shell. 
The DPS ferroxidase site is unusual in that it is not located 
in a four-helix bundle as in ferritin, but is shared by 
2-fold symmetry-related subunits providing the iron ligands. 
Many DPS sequences (e.g., E. coli) display an N-terminal 
extension of variable length that contains two or three positively 
charged lysine residues that extends into the solvent 
and is thought to play an important role in the stabilization 
of the complex with DNA. DPS Listeria Flp, Bacillus anthracis 
Dlp-1 and Dlp-2, and Helicobacter pylori HP-NAP which lack 
the N-terminal extension, do not bind DNA. DPS proteins 
from Helicobacter pylori, Treponema pallidum, and Borrelia burgdorferi 
are highly immunogenic.

>gnl|CDD|215003 smart01060, Catalase, Catalases are antioxidant enzymes that 
catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular 
oxygen, serving to protect cells from its toxic effects. 
 Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a consequence of oxidative 
cellular metabolism and can be converted to the highly 
reactive hydroxyl radical via transition metals, this radical 
being able to damage a wide variety of molecules within a 
cell, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Catalases 
act to neutralise hydrogen peroxide toxicity, and are produced 
by all aerobic organisms ranging from bacteria to man. Most 
catalases are mono-functional, haem-containing enzymes, 
although there are also bifunctional haem-containing peroxidase/catalases 
that are closely related to plant peroxidases, 
and non-haem, manganese-containing catalases that are found 
in bacteria.

in eukaryotes based on the subunit compositions. Archaeal 
RNAP is a large multi-protein complex, made up of 11 
to 13 subunits, depending on the species, that are responsible 
for the synthesis of RNA. Structure studies suggest that 
RNAP complexes from different organisms share a crab-claw-shaped 
structure. The largest eukaryotic RNAP subunit is encoded 
by two separate archaeal subunits (A' and A'') which correspond 
to the N- and C-terminal domains of eukaryotic RNAP II 
Rpb1, respectively. The N-terminal domain of Rpb1 forms part 
of the active site and includes the head and the core of 
one clamp as well as the pore and funnel structures of RNAP 
II. Based on a structural comparison among the archaeal, bacterial 
and eukaryotic RNAPs the DNA binding channel and the 
active site are part of A' subunit which is conserved. The strong 
similarity between subunit A' and the N-terminal domain 
of Rpb1 suggests a similar functional and structural role 
for these two proteins.

pathways for secondary metabolites. Some well studied 
proteins in this CD are AHBA_synthase, protein product of 
pleiotropic regulatory gene degT,  Arnb aminotransferase and 
pilin glycosylation protein. The prototype of this family, 
the AHBA_synthase, is a dimeric PLP dependent enzyme. AHBA_syn 
is the terminal enzyme of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) 
formation which is involved in the biosynthesis of ansamycin 
antibiotics, including rifamycin B. Some members of this 
CD are involved in 4-amino-6-deoxy-monosaccharide D-perosamine 
synthesis. Perosamine is an important element in the 
glycosylation of several cell products, such as antibiotics 
and lipopolysaccharides of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. 
The pilin glycosylation protein encoded by gene pglA, 
is a galactosyltransferase involved in pilin glycosylation. 
Additionally, this CD consists of ArnB (PmrH) aminotransferase, 
a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose lipopolysaccharide-modifying 
enzyme. This CD also consists of several predicted pyridoxal 
phosphate-dependent enzymes apparently involved in regulation 
of cell wall biogenesis. The catalytic lysine which 
is present in all characterized PLP dependent enzymes is replaced 
by histidine in some members of this CD.
