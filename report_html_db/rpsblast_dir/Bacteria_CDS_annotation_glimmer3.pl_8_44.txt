ExoVII is a single-strand-specific exonuclease which degrades 
ssDNA from both 3-prime and 5-prime ends. ExoVII plays 
a role in methyl-directed mismatch repair in vivo. ExoVII may 
also guard the genome from mutagenesis by removing excess

>gnl|CDD|187638 cd08933, RDH_SDR_c, retinal dehydrogenase-like, classical (c) 
SDR.  These classical SDRs includes members identified as retinol 
dehydrogenases, which convert retinol to retinal, a property 
that overlaps with 17betaHSD activity. 17beta-dehydrogenases 
are a group of isozymes that catalyze activation and 
inactivation of estrogen and androgens, and include members 
of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductase family. SDRs are 
a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have 
a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold 
(alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an 
NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal 
region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues 
long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence 
identity between different SDR enzymes are typically 
in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold 
NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic 
sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range 
of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, 
carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, 
and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG 
cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with 
the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical 
catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin 
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr 
and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH 
numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing 
to the active site; while substrate binding is in the 
C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard 
reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton 
relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule 
stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have 
additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically 
have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) 
SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase 
have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site 
motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G 
NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost 
catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif 
and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions 
catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, 
epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, 
dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol 
oxidoreduction.

>gnl|CDD|233511 TIGR01654, bact_immun_7tm, bacteriocin-associated integral membrane 
(putative immunity) protein.  This model represents a 
family of integral membrane proteins, most of which are about 
650 residues in size and predicted to span the membrane seven 
times. Nearly half of the members of this family are found 
in association with a member of the lactococcin 972 family 
of bacteriocins (TIGR01653). Others may be associated with 
uncharacterized proteins that may also act as bacteriocins. 
Although this protein is suggested to be an immunity protein, 
and the bacteriocin is suggested to be exported by a Sec-dependent 
process, the role of this protein is unclear [Cellular 
processes, Toxin production and resistance].

>gnl|CDD|256350 pfam11202, PRTase_1, Phosphoribosyl transferase (PRTase).  This 
PRTase family has a C terminal RNA binding Pelota domain. 
These genes are found in the biosynthetic operon associated 
with the Ter stress response operon and are predicted to be 
involved in the biosynthesis of a ribo- nucleoside involved 
in stress response.

>gnl|CDD|253971 pfam06904, Extensin-like_C, Extensin-like protein C-terminus. 
 This family represents the C-terminus (approx. 120 residues) 
of a number of bacterial extensin-like proteins. Extensins 
are cell wall glycoproteins normally associated with plants, 
where they strengthen the cell wall in response to mechanical 
stress. Note that many family members of this family are 
hypothetical.

>gnl|CDD|240508 cd06084, KOW_Spt5_4, KOW domain of Spt5, repeat 4.  Spt5, an 
eukaryotic ortholog of NusG, contains multiple KOW motifs at 
its C-terminus. Spt5 is involved in transcription elongation 
and termination. KOW domain is known as an RNA-binding motif 
that is shared so far among some families of ribosomal proteins, 
the essential bacterial transcriptional elongation factor 
NusG, the eukaryotic chromatin elongation factor Spt5, 
the higher eukaryotic KIN17 proteins and Mtr4. KOW_Spt5 domains 
play critical roles in recruitment of multiple other eukaryotic 
transcription elongation and RNA biogenesis factors 
and additionally are involved in the binding of the eukaryotic 
Spt5 proteins to RNA polymerases.
