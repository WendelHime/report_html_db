>gnl|CDD|132919 cd07036, TPP_PYR_E1-PDHc-beta_like, Pyrimidine (PYR) binding 
domain of the beta subunits of the E1 components of human pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex (E1- PDHc) and related proteins. 
 Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) family, pyrimidine (PYR) binding 
domain of the beta subunits of the E1 components of: human 
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E1- PDHc), the acetoin dehydrogenase 
complex (ADC), and the branched chain alpha-keto 
acid dehydrogenase/2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase complex 
(BCADC), subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic 
enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) 
as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain 
and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine 
ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. 
A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the 
PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is 
shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the 
activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, 
but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain 
is not included in this sub-family. E1-PDHc is an alpha2beta2 
dimer-of-heterodimers having two active sites lying between 
PYR and PP domains of separate subunits, the PYR domains 
are arranged on the beta subunit, the PP domains on the 
alpha subunits. PDHc catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation 
of pyruvate to produce acetyl-CoA in the bridging 
step between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. ADC participates 
in the breakdown of acetoin. BCADC catalyzes the 
oxidative decarboxylation of 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate 
and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate during the 
breakdown of branched chain amino acids.

>gnl|CDD|132916 cd07033, TPP_PYR_DXS_TK_like, Pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain 
of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), transketolase 
(TK), and related proteins.  Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) 
family, pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate 
synthase (DXS), transketolase (TK), and the 
beta subunits of the E1 component of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase 
complex (E1- PDHc), subfamily. The PYR domain is 
found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known 
as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft 
formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, 
binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds

ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, 
and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains 
have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. 
The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. 
Like many TPP-dependent enzymes DXS and TK are homodimers 
having a PYR and a PP domain on the same subunit. TK has two 
active sites per dimer which lie between PYR and PP domains 
of different subunits. For DXS each active site is located 
at the interface of a PYR and a PP domain from the same subunit. 
E1-PDHc is an alpha2beta2 dimer-of-heterodimers having 
two active sites but having the PYR and PP domains arranged 
on separate subunits, the PYR domains on the beta subunits, 
the PP domains on the alpha subunits. DXS is a regulatory enzyme 
of the mevalonate-independent pathway involved in terpenoid 
biosynthesis, it catalyzes a transketolase-type condensation 
of pyruvate with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to form 
1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) and carbon dioxide. TK 
catalyzes the transfer of a two-carbon unit from ketose phosphates 
to aldose phosphates. In heterotrophic organisms, TK 
provides a link between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate 
pathway and provides precursors for nucleotide, aromatic amino 
acid and vitamin biosynthesis. TK also plays a central 
role in the Calvin cycle in plants. PDHc catalyzes the irreversible 
oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to produce acetyl-CoA 
in the bridging step between glycolysis and the citric 
acid cycle. This subfamily includes the beta subunits of 
the E1 component of the acetoin dehydrogenase complex (ADC) 
and the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase/2-oxoisovalerate 
dehydrogenase complex (BCADC). ADC participates in 
the breakdown of acetoin. BCADC catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation 
of 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate 
and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate during the breakdown of branched 
chain amino acids.
