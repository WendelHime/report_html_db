>gnl|CDD|131341 TIGR02288, PaaN_2, phenylacetic acid degradation protein paaN. 
 This enzyme is proposed to act in the ring-opening step of 
phenylacetic acid degradation which follows ligation of the 
acid with coenzyme A (by PaaF) and hydroxylation by a multicomponent 
non-heme iron hydroxylase complex (PaaGHIJK). Gene 
symbols have been standardized in. This enzyme is related 
to aldehyde dehydrogenases and has a domain which is a member 
of the pfam00171 family. This family includes sequences from 
Burkholderia, Bordetella, Streptomyces. Other PaaN enzymes 
are represented by a separate model, TIGR02278.

>gnl|CDD|239903 cd04456, S1_IF1A_like, S1_IF1A_like: Translation initiation factor 
IF1A-like, S1-like RNA-binding domain. IF1A is also referred 
to as eIF1A in eukaryotes and aIF1A in archaea. S1-like 
RNA-binding domains are found in a wide variety of RNA-associated 
proteins. IF1A is essential for translation initiation. 
eIF1A acts synergistically with eIF1 to mediate assembly 
of ribosomal initiation complexes at the initiation codon 
and maintain the accuracy of this process by recognizing and 
destabilizing aberrant preinitiation complexes from the mRNA. 
Without eIF1A and eIF1, 43S ribosomal preinitiation complexes 
can bind to the cap-proximal region, but are unable to 
reach the initiation codon. eIF1a also enhances the formation 
of 5'-terminal complexes in the presence of other translation 
initiation factors. This protein family is only found in 
eukaryotes and archaea.

>gnl|CDD|233445 TIGR01511, ATPase-IB1_Cu, copper-(or silver)-translocating P-type 
ATPase.  This model describes the P-type ATPase primarily 
responsible for translocating copper ions accross biological 
membranes. These transporters are found in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes. This model encompasses those species which pump 
copper ions out of cells or organelles (efflux pumps such 
as CopA of Escherichia coli ) as well as those which pump the 
ion into cells or organelles either for the purpose of supporting 
life in extremely low-copper environments (for example 
CopA of Enterococcus hirae ) or for the specific delivery 
of copper to a biological complex for which it is a necessary 
component (for example FixI of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, 
or CtaA and PacS of Synechocystis). The substrate specificity 
of these transporters may, to a varying degree, include silver 
ions (for example, CopA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus). 
Copper transporters from this family are well known as the genes 
which are mutated in two human disorders of copper metabolism, 
Wilson's and Menkes' diseases. The sequences contributing 
to the seed of this model are all experimentally characterized. 
The copper P-type ATPases have been characterized 
as Type IB based on a phylogenetic analysis which combines the 
copper-translocating ATPases with the cadmium-translocating 
species. This model and that describing the cadmium-ATPases 
(TIGR01512) are well separated, and thus we further type 
the copper-ATPases as IB1 (and the cadmium-ATPases as IB2). 
Several sequences which have not been characterized experimentally 
fall just below the cutoffs for both of these models. 
A sequence from Enterococcus faecalis scores very high against 
this model, but yet is annotated as an "H+/K+ exchanging 
ATPase". BLAST of this sequence does not hit anything else 
annotated in this way. This error may come from the characterization 
paper published in 1987. Accession GP|7415611 from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to be mis-annotated as a cadmium 
resistance protein. Accession OMNI|NTL01HS00542 from Halobacterium 
which scores above trusted for this model is annotated 
as "molybdenum-binding protein" although no evidence 
can be found for this classification [Cellular processes, Detoxification, 
Transport and binding proteins, Cations and iron 
carrying compounds].

>gnl|CDD|147617 pfam05535, Chromadorea_ALT, Chromadorea ALT protein.  This family 
consists of several ALT protein homologues found in nematodes. 
Lymphatic filariasis is a major tropical disease caused 
by the mosquito borne nematodes Brugia and Wuchereria. About 
120 million people are infected and at risk of lymphatic 
pathology such as acute lymphangitis and elephantiasis. Expression 
of alt-1 and alt-2 is initiated midway through development 
in the mosquito, peaking in the infective larva and 
declining sharply following entry into the host. ALT-1 and the 
closely related ALT-2 have been found to be strong candidates 
for a future vaccine against human filariasis.
