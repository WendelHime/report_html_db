>gnl|CDD|176111 cd08419, PBP2_CbbR_RubisCO_like, The C-terminal substrate binding 
of LysR-type transcriptional regulator (CbbR) of RubisCO 
operon, which is involved in the carbon dioxide fixation, 
contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold.  CbbR, a LysR-type 
transcriptional regulator, is required to activate expression 
of RubisCO, one of two unique enzymes in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham 
(CBB) cycle pathway. All plants, cyanobacteria, 
and many autotrophic bacteria use the CBB cycle to fix carbon 
dioxide. Thus, this cycle plays an essential role in assimilating 
CO2 into organic carbon on earth. The key CBB cycle 
enzyme is ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase 
(RubisCO), which catalyzes the actual CO2 fixation reaction. 
The CO2 concentration affects the expression of RubisCO genes. 
 It has also shown that NADPH enhances the DNA-binding ability 
of the CbbR. RubisCO is composed of eight large (CbbL) 
and eight small subunits (CbbS).  The topology of this substrate-binding 
domain is most similar to that of the type 2 
periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for 
the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, 
sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. 
The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these 
domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding 
their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact 
with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two 
integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located 
ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation 
across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

genes of Rhizobia are regulated by the nodD gene product in 
response to host-produced flavonoids and appear to encode enzymes 
involved in the production of a lipo-chitose signal molecule 
required for infection and nodule formation. NodZ is 
required for the addition of a 2-O-methylfucose residue to 
the terminal reducing N-acetylglucosamine of the nodulation 
signal. This substitution is essential for the biological activity 
of this molecule. Mutations in nodZ result in defective 
nodulation. nodZ represents a unique nodulation gene that 
is not under the control of NodD and yet is essential for the 
synthesis of an active nodulation signal.

>gnl|CDD|176254 cd08294, leukotriene_B4_DH_like, 13-PGR is a bifunctional enzyme 
with delta-13 15-prostaglandin reductase and leukotriene 
B4 12 hydroxydehydrogenase activity.  Prostaglandins and related 
eicosanoids are metabolized by the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl 
group of the NAD+-dependent (type I 15-PGDH) 15-prostaglandin 
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) followed by reduction 
by NADPH/NADH-dependent (type II 15-PGDH) delta-13 15-prostaglandin 
reductase (13-PGR) to 15-keto- 13,14,-dihydroprostaglandins. 
13-PGR is a bifunctional enzyme, since it also has 
leukotriene B(4) 12-hydroxydehydrogenase activity. These 15-PGDH 
and related enzymes are members of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase 
family. The medium chain dehydrogenases/reductase 
(MDR)/zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase-like 
family, which contains the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ADH-Zn) and related proteins, is a diverse group of proteins 
related to the first identified member, class I mammalian 
ADH.  MDRs display a broad range of activities and are distinguished 
from the smaller short chain dehydrogenases (~ 
250 amino acids vs. the ~ 350 amino acids of the MDR). The MDR 
proteins have 2 domains: a C-terminal NAD(P) binding-Rossmann 
fold domain of a beta-alpha form and an N-terminal catalytic 
domain with distant homology to GroES.

>gnl|CDD|131387 TIGR02334, prpF, probable AcnD-accessory protein PrpF.  The 2-methylcitrate 
cycle is one of at least five degradation pathways 
for propionate via propionyl-CoA. Degradation of propionate 
toward pyruvate consumes oxaloacetate and releases succinate. 
Oxidation of succinate back into oxaloacetate by the 
TCA cycle makes the 2-methylcitrate pathway a cycle. This family 
consists of PrpF, an incompletely characterized protein 
that appears to be an essential accessory protein for the 
Fe/S-dependent 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase AcnD (TIGR02333). 
This protein is related to but distinct from FldA (part 
of Pfam family pfam04303), a putative fluorene degradation protein 
of Sphingomonas sp. LB126 [Energy metabolism, Fermentation].

>gnl|CDD|176112 cd08420, PBP2_CysL_like, C-terminal substrate binding domain 
of LysR-type transcriptional regulator CysL, which activates 
the transcription of the cysJI operon encoding sulfite reductase, 
contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold.  CysL, 
also known as YwfK, is a regular of sulfur metabolism in Bacillus 
subtilis. Sulfur is required for the synthesis of proteins 
and essential cofactors in all living organism. Sulfur 
can be assimilated either from inorganic sources (sulfate and 
thiosulfate), or from organic sources (sulfate esters, sulfamates, 
and sulfonates). CysL activates the transcription of 
the cysJI operon encoding sulfite reductase, which reduces 
sulfite to sulfide. Both cysL mutant and cysJI mutant are unable 
to grow using sulfate or sulfite as the sulfur source. 
Like other LysR-type regulators, CysL also negatively regulates 
its own transcription. In Escherichia coli, three LysR-type 
activators are involved in the regulation of sulfur metabolism: 
CysB, Cbl and MetR.  The topology of this substrate-binding 
domain is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic 
binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the 
uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, 
polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine. 
The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains 
in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their 
specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with 
a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral 
membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase 
domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation 
across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

>gnl|CDD|176518 cd08576, GDPD_like_SMaseD_PLD, Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase-like 
domain of spider venom sphingomyelinases D, bacterial 
phospholipase D, and similar proteins.  This subfamily 
corresponds to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase-like 
domain (GDPD-like) present in sphingomyelinases D (SMases 
D) (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase D, EC 3.1.4.4) from 
spider venom, the Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis Phospholipase 
D (PLD)-like protein from pathogenic bacteria, and 
the Ajellomyces capsulatus H143 PLD-like protein from ascomycetes. 
Spider SMases D and bacterial PLD proteins catalyze the 
Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis of sphingomyelin producing choline 
and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), which possess a number of 
biological functions, such as regulating cell proliferation 
and apoptosis, participating in inflammatory responses, and 
playing a key role in phagocytosis. In the presence of Mg2+, 
SMases D can function as lysophospholipase D and hydrolyze 
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to choline and lysophosphatidic 
acid (LPA), which is a multifunctional phospholipid involved 
in platelet aggregation, endothelial hyperpermeability, 
and pro-inflammatory responses. Loxosceles spider venoms' SMases 
D are the principal toxins responsible for dermonecrosis 
and complement dependent haemolysis induced by spider venom. 
Due to amino acid substitutions at the entrance to the active-site 
pocket, some members lack activity. The typical GDPD 
domain consists of a TIM barrel and a small insertion domain 
named as the GDPD-insertion (GDPD-I) domain, which is specific 
for GDPD proteins.  Although proteins in this family 
contain a non-typical GDPD domain which lacks the GDPD-I, their 
catalytic mechanisms are based on Mg2+-dependent acid-base 
reactions similar to GDPD proteins. They might be divergent 
members of the GDPD family. Moreover, this family does not 
belong to phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily, since it lacks 
the conserved HKD sequence motif that characterizes the catalytic 
center of the PLD superfamily. It belongs to the superfamily 
of PLC-like phosphodiesterases.
